- Email: security@rahulchaube.dev
- Include detailed vulnerability description
- Provide proof of concept if possible

### 🔒 **Security Enhancement Areas**
- Cryptographic implementations
- Key management
- Authentication mechanisms
- Secure coding practices

## 🧪 **Testing Guidelines**

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_security.py
python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Include integration tests for major features
- Add performance benchmarks for optimizations
- Test security features thoroughly

## 📝 **Code Standards**

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for all functions/classes
- Keep functions small and focused

### Security Standards
- Use secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Handle errors gracefully
- Never log sensitive information

### Example Code Structure
```python
def create_pattern(data: str, duration: int = 30) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Create a revolutionary pattern with encryption.
    
    Args:
        data: The data to encode
        duration: Pattern lifetime in seconds
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing encrypted pattern data
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If data is invalid
        SecurityError: If encryption fails
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```
